# Balanced Binary Tree
This course project contains a program that builds a balanced AVL-tree from a file.
You can add nodes to this tree and search for keys inside the tree.
You can choose not to print the tree in every step to produce larger trees much faster.
## Setup
To run this project, you must compile it first:
```
$ gcc AVLtreeProject.c -o avl -Wall -ansi -std=c99
$ ./avl
```
## Input files
This repository contains 4 input files:
* input.txt - 9 numbers based on the original task description
* input1.txt - 20 random numbers between 0-20.
* input2.txt - numbers 1-10 000 ordered randomly
* input3.txt - numbers 1-1 000 000 ordered randomly (warning, large file)

If you want to make your own input files, the numbers should be separated with a space.
